            <p>I got into anime when I was about 15 years old. My first anime was an old one called 
                soul eater. It was really good for back in the day and proablly still holds up by 
                today standards but is nowhere near my favorite anime of all time. </p>

                <img src = "photos/86.jpg" alt = "the manga cover art for 86" class = "animePhoto">
                <p>86 is my favortie anime because of how it just sucks the reader into the story.</p>   
            </div>
            <div class = "animePhotoDiv">
                <img src = "photos/onepiece.jpg" alt = "the manga cover art for one piece" class = "animePhoto">
                <p>
                    OnePiece is my all time favorite anime becasue of how complex the wolrd building is.

                <img src = "photos/drsonte.jpg" alt = "the cover art of the manga Dr. stone" class = "animePhoto">
                <p> 
                    Dr. Stone is another one of my favorite animes becasue of its complicated involvment of actauly physics and chemistry.
